      <description>A Settings Bundle is a collection of settings, uniquely identified by the key of the extension registering the bundle and the key of the bundle itself. It&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to let oCIS extensions define settings and make them available to users. They are dynamically rendered into forms, available in the frontend.
As of now we support five different types of settings:
 boolean integer string single choice list of integers or strings multiple choice list of integers or strings  Each Setting is uniquely identified by a key within the bundle.</description>

      <description>A Settings Value is the value an authenticated user has chosen for a specific setting, defined in a settings bundle. For choosing settings values as a user the sole entry point is the ocis-web extension provided by this service.
Identifying settings values A settings value is uniquely identified by four attributes. Three of them are coming from the definition of the setting within it&amp;rsquo;s settings bundle (see Settings Bundles for an example).</description>
