      <title>6. Service Discovery within oCIS and Reva</title>

      <description>6. Service Discovery within oCIS and Reva  Status: proposed Deciders: @refs, @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @pmaier1 Date: 2021-04-19  Technical Story: Introduce Named Services.
Context and Problem Statement Reva relies heavily on config files. A known implication of this approach are having to know a-priori where a service is running (host + port). We want to move away from hardcoded values and rely instead on named services for service discovery. Furthermore, we would like both platforms (Reva + oCIS) to have the same source of truth at any given time, not having one to notify the other whenever a service status changes.</description>

      <title>3. Use external User Management</title>

      <description>Status: accepted Deciders: @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @hodyroff, @pmaier1 Date: 2020-12-09  Technical Story: Skip account-service by talking to CS3 user-api
Context and Problem Statement To attach metadata like shares to users ownCloud relies on persistent, non-reassignable, unique identifiers for users (and files). Email and username can change when a user changes his name. But even the OIDC sub+iss combination may change when the IdP changes. While there is an account porting protocol that describes how a relying party (RP) such as ownCloud should behave, it still requires the RP to maintain its own user identifiers.</description>

      <description>4. Support Hot Migration  Status: proposed Deciders: @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @hodyroff, @pmaier1 Date: 2021-03-16  Technical Story: [description | ticket/issue URL]
Context and Problem Statement Migration is one of the most important topics of the oCIS story. We need to provide a concept how to migrate from oC10 to oCIS.
Decision Drivers  Do not lose file blob or meta data.  To prevent a sync surge from clients the etag for files should be migrated.</description>

      <title>2. Persist accounts in a CS3 storage</title>

      <description>Status: accepted Deciders: @butonic, @felixboehm Date: 2020-08-21  Technical Story: File system based indexing
Context and Problem Statement To set up High Availability (HA) or a geo-replicated setup we need to persist accounts in a distributed way. To efficiently query the accounts by email or username, and not only by id, they need to be indexed. Unfortunately, the bleve index we currently store locally on disk cannot be shared by multiple instances, preventing a scale out deployment.</description>
