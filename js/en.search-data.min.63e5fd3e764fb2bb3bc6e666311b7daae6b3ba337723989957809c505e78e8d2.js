Visit installation to see how to integrate the File picker into your product.\nComponents of the File picker The file picker can be used in two different variations: File picker and location picker.\nFile picker The file picker enables users to select multiple resources and is intended to bring resources from within ownCloud into your web applications.\nLocation picker The location picker allows only one folder to be selected and its main purpose is to enable users to save files into the connected ownCloud instance.\n"});index.add({'id':7,'href':'/integration/file_picker/installation/','title':"Installation",'content':"    Setup authorization Install File picker package Integrate in HTML page with vanilla JavaScript Integrate in Vue web application Set correct variation     Setup authorization The config for authorization is provided via a json file. Location of the file can be provided via a prop called configLocation. This requires full URL address (e.g. https://\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;path-to-the-config\u0026gt;). If the prop is not defined, the location will fallback to https://\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/file-picker-config.json. The config can point to both oauth2 and OIDC. You can take a look at the following example to see how OIDC can be defined:\n{ \u0026#34;server\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;owncloud-server\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;openIdConnect\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;metadata_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/.well-known/openid-configuration\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;authority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;client_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;client-id\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;response_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;openid profile email\u0026#34; }, } Install File picker package To integrate File picker into your own product, you can install it via one of the following commands:\nnpm install @ownclouders/file-picker --save # OR yarn add @ownclouders/file-picker Integrate in HTML page with vanilla JavaScript When including File picker in an HTML page, it is important to include Vue.js as well. In this case, we will import it via unpkg. Without this, the component won\u0026rsquo;t work. Vue needs to be included also if you\u0026rsquo;re importing the File picker into a web application built with other framework than Vue (e.g. React, Angular).\nFor the purpose of this example, we will assume that you do not move installed packages and include the folder \u0026ldquo;node_modules\u0026rdquo; with installed packages in the same location as your index.html file on your server.\n... \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;File picker example\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://unpkg.com/vue\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;./node_modules/file-picker/dist/file-picker.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;file-picker id=\u0026#34;file-picker\u0026#34; variation=\u0026#34;resource\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/file-picker\u0026gt; Integrate in Vue web application There is a caveat when using the File picker inside an existing Vue application. Since the web component will be imported before Vue, we need to define it as a global variable on our own. This requires us to separate the import of Vue into a bootstrap file.\nvue.js:\nimport Vue from \u0026#39;vue\u0026#39; window.Vue = Vue main.js:\nimport Vue from \u0026#39;./vue\u0026#39; new Vue(...)

To define which one should be used, you need to pass it to the component via its variation property.

Settings usage:\n Extensions can query ocis-settings for settings values of a user. The ownCloud SDK, used as a data abstraction layer for ocis-web, will query ocis-settings for settings values of a user, if it\u0026rsquo;s available.

You could miss updates on this file. Run make clean to delete the file and keep the development environment tidy otherwise as well.  Add your hostname to the idp config Let us assume your-host is your remote domain name or IP adress.

Instead, each extension could either be configured by environment variables, cli flags or config files.\nEach extension has its dedicated documentation page (e.g. https://owncloud.github.io/extensions/ocis_konnectd/configuration) which lists all possible configurations. Config files and environment variables are picked up if you use the ./bin/ocis server command within the oCIS single binary. Command line flags must be set explicitly on the extensions subcommands.\nConfiguration using config files Out of the box extensions will attempt to read configuration details from:\n/etc/ocis $HOME/.ocis ./config For this configuration to be picked up, have a look at your extension root command and look for which default config name it has assigned. i.e: ocis-konnectd reads konnectd.json | yaml | toml ....\nSo far we support the file formats JSON and YAML, if you want to get a full example configuration just take a look at our repository, there you can always see the latest configuration format. These example configurations include all available options and the default values. The configuration file will be automatically loaded if it\u0026rsquo;s placed at /etc/ocis/ocis.yml, ${HOME}/.ocis/ocis.yml or $(pwd)/config/ocis.yml.\nEnvironment variables If you prefer to configure the service with environment variables you can see the available variables below.\nCommandline flags If you prefer to configure the service with commandline flags you can see the available variables below.

Instead, each extension could either be configured by environment variables, cli flags or config files.\nEach extension has its dedicated documentation page (e.g. https://owncloud.github.io/extensions/ocis_accounts/configuration) which lists all possible configurations. Config files and environment variables are picked up if you use the ./bin/ocis server command within the oCIS single binary. Command line flags must be set explicitly on the extensions subcommands.\nConfiguration using config files Out of the box extensions will attempt to read configuration details from:\n/etc/ocis $HOME/.ocis ./config For this configuration to be picked up, have a look at your extension root command and look for which default config name it has assigned. i.e: ocis-accounts reads accounts.json | yaml | toml ....\nSo far we support the file formats JSON and YAML, if you want to get a full example configuration just take a look at our repository, there you can always see the latest configuration format. These example configurations include all available options and the default values.

The most important part is that oidc connects to the user backend of ownCloud 10. This is achieved by exposing the user backend with the graph api plugin in ownCloud 10 and connecting to it with glauth in ocis.\nGlauth needs to be configured to utilize oc10 as primary user backend:\nGLAUTH_BACKEND_DATASTORE:owncloudGLAUTH_BACKEND_SERVERS:https://${OC10_DOMAIN}/apps/graphapi/v1.0To allow konnectd to connect to glauth, ldap needs to be configured:\n# Konnectd ldap setupLDAP_URI:ldap://localhost:9125LDAP_BINDDN:\u0026#34;cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org\u0026#34;LDAP_BINDPW:\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;LDAP_BASEDN:\u0026#34;dc=example,dc=org\u0026#34;LDAP_SCOPE:subLDAP_LOGIN_ATTRIBUTE:uidLDAP_EMAIL_ATTRIBUTE:mailLDAP_NAME_ATTRIBUTE:givenNameLDAP_UUID_ATTRIBUTE:uidLDAP_UUID_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE:textLDAP_FILTER:\u0026#34;(objectClass=posixaccount)\u0026#34;oc10 OwnCloud 10 needs the graph api extensions to work in this setup. This extension is needed for Glauth to get oc10 users. It\u0026rsquo;s necessary to add an image build step which extends owncloud/server:latest docker image with the app. The app is provided as tarball in the folder oc10/apps.\n└───oc10 │ │ Dockerfile │ │ │ └───apps │ │ │ graphapi-0.1.0.tar.gz The docker file is pretty simple\n# Take the latest owncloud/server image as baseFROMowncloud/server:latest# Add the provided tarballs into oc10\u0026#39;s apps folderADD apps/graphapi-0.1.0.tar.gz /var/www/owncloud/apps/The build is triggered by the terminal command docker-compose build from the root folder.\nConstraints: In this setup it\u0026rsquo;s mandatory that the user has an email address set and is assigned to at least one group in oc10. Especially the default admin user doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an email assigned. If your admin user doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an email address, yet, please set one: docker-compose exec owncloud occ user:modify admin email \u0026quot;admin@example.org\u0026quot;\nLocal setup For simple local ocis setup see Getting started\nIf you want to start the bridge setup on your local development machine, there are a few steps necessary:\nDomains Instead of replacing the domains in the config files you can add ocis.example.org and oc10.example.org as localhost aliases to your /etc/hosts file:\n127.0.0.1 oc10.example.org 127.0.0.1 ocis.example.org Disable certificate checks The docker-compose.yml file contains some *INSECURE environment variables for enabling or disabling certificate checks.

The available configuration methods have already been mentioned above. Generally you can always see a formated help output if you execute the binary via ocis-settings --help.\nServer The server command is used to start the http and debug server on two addresses within a single process. The http server is serving the general webservice while the debug server is used for health check, readiness check and to server the metrics mentioned below. For further help please execute:\nsettings server --help Health The health command is used to execute a health check, if the exit code equals zero the service should be up and running, if the exist code is greater than zero the service is not in a healthy state. Generally this command is used within our Docker containers, it could also be used within Kubernetes.\nsettings health --help Version The version command lists the versions of all running instances. For further help please execute:\nsettings version --help Metrics This service provides some Prometheus metrics through the debug endpoint, you can optionally secure the metrics endpoint by some random token, which got to be configured through one of the flag --debug-token or the environment variable SETTINGS_DEBUG_TOKEN mentioned above.

One reason might be that the binary was already built but does not match the container env. Try running make clean before running docker-compose up ocis so it gets built inside the container.\nWhere are the logs ? The ocis logs can be accessed using docker-compose logs ocis. Add -f for following.\nHow do I update a service in the ocis container?  docker-compose exec ocis make clean build to update the binary docker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis kill \u0026lt;service\u0026gt; to kill the service docker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis run \u0026lt;service\u0026gt; to start the service. Do not forget to set any env vars, eg. docker-compose exec -e STORAGE_HOME_DRIVER=eoshome -e STORAGE_DRIVER_EOS_LAYOUT=\u0026quot;{{substr 0 1 .Id.OpaqueId}}/{{.Id.OpaqueId}}\u0026quot; ocis ./bin/ocis run storage-home  Creation and upload of files does not work If the upload did not work, please check the status of the eos space using the command docker-compose exec mgm-master eos fs ls. In case the default space appears as offline, run docker-compose exec mgm-master eos space set default on.\nUploading big files appears to hang Please note that the uploads first go into the \u0026ldquo;ocis\u0026rdquo; docker and land in its \u0026ldquo;/tmp\u0026rdquo; folder, then gets copied over to the EOS docker using xrdcopy. This is why uploading first transfers all bytes and then seem to hang for a while during the final copy.\nRunning out of space quickly The EOS dockers are configured with replication, so every file uploaded there will be replicated 4 times, so make sure there is enough physical space on disk when testing.\nAlso please note that older failed uploads might still be present in the \u0026ldquo;/tmp\u0026rdquo; directory of the \u0026ldquo;ocis\u0026rdquo; container.\n"});index.add({'id':47,'href':'/extensions/konnectd/building/','title':"Building",'content':"    Backend     As this project is built with Go, so you need to install that first.

While you could rerun storage storage-oc multiple times with different flags to get multiple instances we are giving the different commands the necessary default configuration to allow the ocis binary to simply start them and not deal with configuration.\nStorage providers To manage the file tree ocis uses storage storage providers that are accessing the underlying storage using a storage driver. The driver can be used to change the implementation of a storage aspect to better reflect the actual underlying storage capabilities. As an example a move operation on a POSIX filesystem (theoretically) is an atomic operation. When trying to implement a file tree on top of S3 there is no native move operation that can be used. A naive implementation might fall back on a COPY and DELETE. Some S3 implementations provide a COPY operation that uses an existing key as the source, so the file at least does not need to be reuploaded. In the worst case scenario, which is renaming a folder with hundreds of thousands of objects, a reupload for every file has to be made. Instead of hiding this complexity a better choice might be to disable renaming of files or at least folders on S3. There are however implementations of filesystems on top of S3 that store the tree metadata in dedicated objects or use a completely different persistence mechanism like a distributed key value store to implement the file tree aspect of a storage.\nWhile the storage provider is responsible for managing the tree, file up and download is delegated to a dedicated data provider. See below.  Storage aspects A lot of different storage technologies exist, ranging from general purpose file systems with POSIX semantics to software defined storage with multiple APIs. Choosing any of them is making a tradeoff decision. Or, if a storage technology is already in place it automatically predetermines the capabilities that can be made available. Not all storage systems are created equal.\nUnfortunately, no POSIX filesystem natively supports all storage aspects that ownCloud 10 requires:\nA hierarchical file tree An important aspect of a filesystem is organizing files and directories in a file hierarchy, or tree. It allows you to create, move and delete nodes. Beside the name a node also has well known metadata like size and mtime that are persisted in the tree as well.\nFolders are not directories There is a difference between folder and directory: a directory is a file system concept. A folder is a metaphor for the concept of a physical file folder. There are also virtual folders or smart folders like the recent files folder which are no file system directories. So, every directory and every virtual folder is a folder, but not every folder is a directory. See the folder metaphor in wikipedia. Also see the activity history below.  Id based lookup While traditionally nodes in the tree are reached by traversing the path the tree persistence should be prepared to look up a node by an id. Think of an inode in a POSIX filesystem. If this operation needs to be cached for performance reasons keep in mind that cache invalidation is hard and crawling all files to update the inode to path mapping takes O(n), not O(1).\nETag propagation For the state based sync a client can discover changes by recursively descending the tree and comparing the ETag for every node. If the storage technology supports propagating ETag changes up the tree, only the root node of a tree needs to be checked to determine if a discovery needs to be started and which nodes need to be traversed. This allows using the storage technology itself to persist all metadata that is necessary for sync, without additional services or caches.\nSubtree size accounting The tree can keep track of how many bytes are stored in a folder. Similar to ETag propagation a change in file size is propagated up the hierarchy.\nETag and Size propagation When propagating the ETag (mtime) and size changes up the tree the question is where to stop. If all changes need to be propagated to the root of a storage then the root or busy folders will become a hotspot. There are two things to keep in mind: 1. propagation only happens up to the root of a single space (a user private drive or a single group drive), 2. no cross storage propagation. The latter was used in oc10 to let clients detect when a file in a received shared folder changed. This functionality is moving to the storage registry which caches the ETag for every root so clients can discover if and which storage changed.  Rename Depending on the underlying storage technology some operations may either be slow, up to a point where it makes more sense to disable them entirely. One example is a folder rename: on S3 a simple folder rename translates to a copy and delete operation for every child of the renamed folder. There is an exception though: this restriction only applies if the S3 storage is treated like a filesystem, where the keys are the path and the value is the file content. There are smarter ways to implement file systems on top of S3, but again: there is always a tradeoff.\nS3 has no rename Technically, S3 has no rename operation at all. By design, the location of the value is determined by the key, so it always has to do a copy and delete. Another example is the redis RENAME operation: while being specified as O(1) it executes an implicit DEL operation, so if the deleted key contains a very big value it may cause high latency\u0026hellip;  Arbitrary metadata persistence In addition to well known metadata like name size and mtime, users might be able to add arbitrary metadata like tags, comments or dublin core. In POSIX filesystems this maps to extended attributes.\nGrant persistence The CS3 API uses grants to describe access permissions. Storage systems have a wide range of permissions granularity and not all grants may be supported by every storage driver. POSIX ACLs for example have no expiry. If the storage system does not support certain grant properties, e.g. expiry, then the storage driver may choose to implement them in a different way. Expiries could be persisted in a different way and checked periodically to remove the grants. Again: every decision is a tradeoff.\nTrash persistence After deleting a node the storage allows listing the deleted nodes and has an undo mechanism for them.\nVersions persistence A user can restore a previous version of a file.\nSnapshots are not versions Modern POSIX filesystems support snapshotting of volumes. This is different from keeping track of versions to a file or folder, but might be another implementation strategy for a storage driver to allow users to restore content.  Activity History The storage keeps an activity history, tracking the different actions that have been performed. This does not only include file changes but also metadata changes like renames and permission changes.\nStorage drivers Reva currently has four storage driver implementations that can be used for storage providers an well as data providers.\nLocal Storage Driver The minimal storage driver for a POSIX based filesystem. It literally supports none of the storage aspect other than basic file tree management. Sharing can - to a degree - be implemented using POSIX ACLs.\n tree provided by a POSIX filesystem  inefficient path by id lookup, currently uses the file path as id, so ids are not stable  can store a uuid in extended attributes and use a cache to look them up, similar to the ownCloud driver   no native ETag propagation, five options are available:  built in propagation (changes bypassing ocis are not picked up until a rescan) built in inotify (requires 48 bytes of RAM per file, needs to keep track of every file and folder) external inotify (same RAM requirement, but could be triggered by external tools, e.g. a workflow engine) kernel audit log (use the linux kernel audit to capture file events on the storage and offload them to a queue) fuse filesystem overlay   no subtree accounting, same options as for ETag propagation efficient rename arbitrary metadata using extended attributes   grant persistence  using POSIX ACLs  requires an LDAP server to make guest accounts available in the OS  OCIS has glauth which contains all users an existing LDAP could be used if guests ar provisioned in another way     using extended attributes to implement expiry or sharing that does not require OS level integration fuse filesystem overlay   no native trash  could use the The FreeDesktop.org Trash specification fuse filesystem overlay   no native versions, multiple options possible  git for folders rcs for single files rsnapshot for hourly / daily / weekly / monthly backups \u0026hellip; but this is not versioning as known from oc10 design new freedesktop spec, basically what is done in oc10 without the limitations or borrow ideas from the freedesktop trash spec fuse filesystem overlay    To provide the other storage aspects we plan to implement a FUSE overlay filesystem which will add the different aspects on top of local filesystems like ext4, btrfs or xfs. It should work on NFSv45 as well, although NFSv4 supports RichACLs and we will explore how to leverage them to implement sharing at a future date. The idea is to use the storages native capabilities to deliver the best user experience. But again: that means making the right tradeoffs.\nOwnCloud Storage Driver This is the current default storage driver. While it implements the file tree (using redis, including id based lookup), ETag propagation, trash, versions and sharing (including expiry) using the data directory layout of ownCloud 10 it has known limitations that cannot be fixed without changing the actual layout on disk.\nTo setup it up properly in a distributed fashion, the storage-home and the storage-oc need to share the same underlying FS. Their \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; counterparts also need access to the same shared FS. For a simple docker-compose setup, you can create a volume which will be used by the \u0026ldquo;storage-storage-home\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;storage-storage-home-data\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;storage-storage-oc\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;storage-storage-oc-data\u0026rdquo; containers. Using the owncloud/ocis docker image, the volume would need to be hooked in the /var/tmp/ocis folder insde the containers.\n tree provided by a POSIX filesystem  file layout is mapped to the old ownCloud 10 layout  the root of tree for a user on disk is prefixed with /path/to/data/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/files/   efficient path by id lookup  all files and folders get assigned a uuid in the extended attributes when starting the storage provider it will walk all files to populate a redis kv store for uuid to path lookup slow to boot trees with lots of nodes   build in ETag propagation  ETags are calculated based on mtime mtime is propagated by the storage driver changes bypassing ocis are not picked up until a restart of the storage provider   no subtree accounting, same options as for local storage efficient rename  TODO update the kv store for path lookup, this is an O(n) operation   arbitrary metadata using extended attributes   grant persistence  using custom ACLs that are stored as extended attributes  a grant corresponds to one extended attribute of 40-100 bytes, effectively limiting the number of shares to ~100-40 extended attributes have varying limitations, based on the underlying filesystem  the linux kernel imposes a limit of 255bytes per name and 64KiB per value ext2/3/4: total bytes for all attributes of a file is limited to 4KiB (a filesystem block) xfs: limit of 64KiB per value btrfs: total bytes used for the name, value, and implementation overhead bytes 16KiB (the default filesystem nodesize value)     does not require OS level integration   built in trash  trashed files are moved to /path/to/data/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/files_trashbin/ trashed files are appended a timestamp .d\u0026lt;unixtime\u0026gt;, which breaks trashing of files that reach the filesystems specific name limit   built in versions  file versions are stored in /path/to/data/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/files_versions/ file versions are appended a timestamp .d\u0026lt;unixtime\u0026gt;, which breaks versioning of files that reach the filesystems specific name limit    EOS Storage Driver The CERN eos storage has evolved with ownCloud and natively supports id based lookup, ETag propagation, subtree size accounting, sharing, trash and versions. To use it you need to change the default configuration of the storage storage-home command (or have a look at the Makefile ̀ eos-start` target):\nexport STORAGE_HOME_DRIVER=eos export STORAGE_DRIVER_EOS_NAMESPACE=/eos export STORAGE_DRIVER_EOS_MASTER_URL=\u0026#34;root://eos-mgm1.eoscluster.cern.ch:1094\u0026#34; export STORAGE_DRIVER_EOS_ENABLE_HOME=true export STORAGE_DRIVER_EOS_LAYOUT=\u0026#34;dockertest/{{.Username}}\u0026#34; Running it locally also requires the eos and xrootd binaries. Running it using make eos-start will use CentOS based containers that already have the necessary packages installed.\nPull requests to add explicit storage storage-(s3|custom|...) commands with working defaults are welcome.  S3 Storage Driver A naive driver that treats the keys in an S3 capable storage as / delimited path names. While it does not support MOVE or ETag propagation it can be used to read and write files. Better integration with native capabilities like versioning is possible but depends on the Use Case. Several storage solutions that provide an S3 interface also support some form of notifications that can be used to implement ETag propagation.\nData Providers Clients using the CS3 API use an InitiateFileDownload and ]InitiateUpload](https://cs3org.github.io/cs3apis/#cs3.storage.provider.v1beta1.InitiateFileUploadRequest) request at the storage gateway to obtain a URL endpoint that can be used to either GET the file content or upload content using the resumable tus.io protocol.\nThe data provider uses the same storage driver as the storage provider but can be scaled independently.\nThe dataprovider allows uploading the file to a quarantine area where further data analysis may happen before making the file accessible again. One use case for this is anti virus scanning for files coming from untrusted sources.\nFuture work FUSE overlay filesystem We are planning to further separate the concerns and use a local storage provider with a FUSE filesystem overlaying the actual POSIX storage that can be used to capture deletes and writes that might happen outside of ocis/reva.\nIt would allow us to extend the local storage driver with missing storage aspects while keeping a tree like filesystem that end users are used to see when sshing into the machine.\nUpload to Quarantine area Antivirus scanning of random files uploaded from untrusted sources and executing metadata extraction or thumbnail generation should happen in a sandboxed system to prevent malicious users from gaining any information about the system. By spawning a new container with access to only the uploaded data we can further limit the attack surface.\n"});index.add({'id':60,'href':'/ocis/development/testing/','title':"Testing",'content':"Acceptance tests We are using the ownCloud 10 acceptance test suite against oCIS.

A: No, the phoenix that is used is compiled into the assets of ocis-phoenix which is currently not automatically updated. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how to use a custom phoenix later.\nbin/ocis server\nOpen the browser at http://localhost:9100\n You land on the login screen. click login You are redirected to an idp at http://localhost:9140/oauth2/auth with a login mask.

You should see Hello %something else%  Q: One of the required ports is already in use. Ocis seems to be trying to restart the service over and over. What gives? A: Using the ocis binary to start the server will case ocis to keep track of the different services and restart them in case they crash.\nHacking ocis-hello go back to the ocis-extension-workshop folder\ncd ..

But how do apps actually talk to the server?\nShort answer: any way you like\nLong answer: micro and ocis-hello follow a protocol driven development:\n  specify the API using protobuf\n  generate client and server code\n  evolve based on the protocol\n  CS3 api uses protobuf as well and uses GRPC\n  ocis uses go-micro, which provides http and grpc gateways\n  the gateways and protocols are optional\n  owncloud and kopano are looking into a MS graph like api to handle phoenix requests.\n they might be about user, contacrs, calendars \u0026hellip; which is covered by the graph api we want to integrate with eg. kopano and provide a commen api (file sync and share is covered as well)    as an example for protobuf take a look at ocis-hello\n  "});index.add({'id':63,'href':'/extensions/glauth/license/','title':"License",'content':"This project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

Unfortunately, this hides the actual source of the error. We could set a breakpoint in line 94 and reproduce the problem, which can be a lot harder than just clicking the share button or sending a curl request again. So let us see what else the log tells us.\nThe previous line tells us that a Stat request failed: uri=/cs3.gateway.v1beta1.GatewayAPI/Stat. This time the line is written by the grpc log interceptor. What else is there?\nThe first line tells us that looking up the responsible storage provider seems to have succeeded: uri=/cs3.storage.registry.v1beta1.RegistryAPI/GetStorageProvider.\nAt this point it your familiarity with the codebase starts to become a factor.

This gives control to every service to define settings that are needed for fulfilling it\u0026rsquo;s intended purpose. There are different types of settings available out of the box - hopefully those already fit your needs. The settings defined through settings bundles can be changed by authenticated users through an ocis-web extension, which is also provided by the settings service. As a result, your service only has to register a settings bundle and oCIS takes care of everything else. Your service can simply use the settings values that were set by users.\nWith this chapter we want to show you, how to register a settings bundle and how to use the respective values that were set by users. We do this by customizing the greeter phrase from our greeter service in ocis-hello.\nYou can find the source code, especially how it\u0026rsquo;s integrated into the service, in the following files:\n pkg/service/v0/service.go for the requests, pkg/command/server.go for the integration of RegisterSettingsBundles into the service start.  Register settings bundle In order to register a settings bundle, you need to create a request message and then send it to the BundleService of ocis-settings through a gRPC call.\nCreate request request := \u0026amp;settings.SaveSettingsBundleRequest{ SettingsBundle: \u0026amp;settings.SettingsBundle{ Identifier: \u0026amp;settings.Identifier{ Extension: \u0026#34;ocis-hello\u0026#34;, BundleKey: \u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;, }, DisplayName: \u0026#34;Greeting\u0026#34;, Settings: []*settings.Setting{ { SettingKey: \u0026#34;phrase\u0026#34;, DisplayName: \u0026#34;Phrase\u0026#34;, Description: \u0026#34;Phrase for replies on the greet request\u0026#34;, Value: \u0026amp;settings.Setting_StringValue{ StringValue: \u0026amp;settings.StringSetting{ Required: true, Default: \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;, MaxLength: 15, }, }, }, }, }, } The request holds only one field, which is a SettingsBundle. It consists of an Identifier, a DisplayName and a list of Settings.\n The Extension and BundleKey inside the Identifier are required and have to be alphanumeric (- and _ are allowed as well). The Identifier has to stay stable - if you change it, existing settings will not be migrated to the new identifier. The DisplayName is required and may contain any UTF8 character. It will be shown in the settings user frontend in a generated form, so please try to be descriptive. You can change the DisplayName at any time. Settings is the list of settings you want to make available with this settings bundle. In this example, there is only one setting defined - a string setting for the phrase our greeter uses in the response. You can explore more types of settings in the settings package. All of them come with their own characteristics and validations. For the phrase setting we decided to set it to Required, so that it can\u0026rsquo;t be empty, and to set a MaxLength of 15 characters, so that the phrase is not too long. The SettingKey is particularly important, as this is used for referencing the setting in other requests. It has to fulfill the same rules as the other Identifier attributes. Please also take the time to set a Description, in order to provide accessibility in the generated forms as good as possible.  Send request to ocis-settings This request message can be sent to the BundleService of ocis-settings like this:\nbundleService := settings.NewBundleService(\u0026#34;com.owncloud.api.settings\u0026#34;, mclient.DefaultClient) response, err := bundleService.SaveSettingsBundle(context.Background(), request) We run this request on every start of ocis-hello so that the settings service always has the most recent version of the settings bundle.\nUse settings value We registered the greeter phrase setting for a reason: We want to allow the authenticated user to customize how they want to be greeted by ocis-hello. In order to do this, we need to ask ocis-settings on every request, what the greeter phrase of the authenticated user is.\nAccount UUID The settings request has one important prerequisite: As our service is stateless, we need to know the account UUID of the authenticated user the incoming POST request to our greeter service is coming from. As that POST request is coming through ocis-proxy, there is an HTTP header x-access-token that holds a JWT with the account UUID in it. We just have to dismantle the JWT to get the UUID. There is a middleware for that in ocis-pkg. You can look up the server configuration for that middleware in pkg/server/http/server.go. In essence, it dismantles the x-access-token, extracts the account UUID and makes it available in the context. It can be subsequently retrieved from the context like this:\nownAccountUUID := ctx.Value(middleware.UUIDKey).(string) Create request With the account UUID we can build an Identifier for the request to ocis-settings as follows:\nrequest := \u0026amp;settings.GetSettingsValueRequest{ Identifier: \u0026amp;settings.Identifier{ Extension: \u0026#34;ocis-hello\u0026#34;, BundleKey: \u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;, SettingKey: \u0026#34;phrase\u0026#34;, AccountUuid: ownAccountUUID, }, } The Identifier for getting a value from ocis-settings needs the three fields for extension, bundle and setting that we chose in the settings bundle. The fourth field is the UUID of the authenticated user.\nSend request to ocis-settings This request message can be sent to the ValueService of ocis-settings like this:\nvalueService := settings.NewValueService(\u0026#34;com.owncloud.api.settings\u0026#34;, mclient.DefaultClient) response, err := valueService.GetSettingsValue(ctx, request) If this request is successful we will have a - possibly customized - greeting phrase. It could also be the default value, if the user didn\u0026rsquo;t customize their phrase in the settings frontend.\nConclusion You have learned how to register settings bundles, how to get the account UUID of the authenticated user and how to query the settings service for settings values.\n"});index.add({'id':81,'href':'/extensions/ocis_hello/testing/','title':"Testing",'content':"This repository provides a general guideline for creating tests for the ocis extensions. The tests can be written in various levels from unit, integration, and end-to-end. It is not essential to write tests on all these levels as it can be redundant in some cases. This repository provides a reference for all levels of tests.\nUnit tests Unit tests generally live inside *_test.go files in the /pkg directory. One such example in this extension is in /pkg/service/v0/service_test.go. Similarly the unit test for the protobuf generated code can also be written just like in /pkg/proto/hello.pb_test.go.\nIntegration tests There are mainly 2 types of integration tests, namely HTTP tests, and GRPC tests. These tests mostly live in /pkg/proto directory where all the protobuf definitions are specified. The examples for the HTTP integration tests are in /pkg/proto/hello.pb.web_test.go whereas the GRPC tests are in /pkg/proto/hello.pb.micro_test.go.\nEnd-to-End tests For extensions with an UI, we can also write end-to-end tests using the Nightwatch test framework. These tests live in /ui/tests directory. We can reuse already existing Gherkin steps from the phoenix tests here.\nRunning the tests Unit and integration tests The unit and integration tests are run using the simple go test command. If you wish to run all the tests with the coverage you can just use make command.\nmake test You can also run a specific file with the go test command\ngo test \u0026lt;path to package or file\u0026gt; End-to-End tests Running end-to-end tests is a bit more complicated than unit and integration tests. First of all we will need a complete ocis setup with ocis-hello running. For that refer to this guide.\nAfter that, We need to set the proper test environment. To run the end-to-end tests, first-of-all we need the phoenix repository where all the test infrastructure exists. So, clone the phoenix repository in your system in any location.\ngit clone https://github.com/owncloud/phoenix $HOME/phoenix Next we will need to start the selenium server which will control the browser. There is a script in the phoenix repo that starts the selenium server, just run that to start selenium.\ncd $HOME/phoenix yarn run selenium Now we can run the tests. The tests will take several configuration variables which can be found here. Without configuration, most of the defaults will work. We just need make sure to set these values through env variable.\nexport PHOENIX_PATH=$HOME/phoenix export OCIS_SKELETON_DIR=\u0026lt;path to the skeleton directory\u0026gt; export PHOENIX_CONFIG=\u0026lt;path to the config.json file used by phoenix\u0026gt; The phoenix path should be set to the directory where the phoenix source files are. Our tests use the existing infrastructure from the phoenix directory to run the tests.\nThe skeleton directory for the webui tests can be found in the testing app. You can just clone that repository in your local machine and point the env variable to the correct path.\nWhile running ocis we should always use a config file for phoenix because our tests will read this file and sometimes even change it which cannot be done if you use env variables or the default values.\nWith all this in place we can just run the tests with a simple make command. First go to the ocis-hello repository\ncd \u0026lt;path to ocis-hello\u0026gt; Then Simply run\nmake test-acceptance-webui To run just one feature you can run\nmake test-acceptance-webui \u0026lt;path-to-feature file\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;line-number\u0026gt; "});index.add({'id':82,'href':'/extensions/settings/values/','title':"Settings Values",'content':"A Settings Value is the value an authenticated user has chosen for a specific setting, defined in a settings bundle. For choosing settings values as a user the sole entry point is the ocis-web extension provided by this service.\nIdentifying settings values A settings value is uniquely identified by four attributes. Three of them are coming from the definition of the setting within it\u0026rsquo;s settings bundle (see Settings Bundles for an example). The fourth identifies the user.\n extension: Key of the extension that registered the settings bundle, bundleKey: Key of the settings bundle, settingKey: Key of the setting as defined within the bundle, accountUuid: The UUID of the authenticated user who has saved the setting.  When requests are going through ocis-proxy, the accountUuid attribute can be set to the static keyword me instead of using a real UUID. ocis-proxy will take care of minting the UUID of the authenticated user into a JWT, providing it in the HTTP header as x-access-token. That UUID is then used in this service, to replace me with the actual UUID of the authenticated user.

However, services can use the respective gRPC endpoints of the ValueService to query and modify settings values as well. The gRPC endpoints require the same identifier attributes as described above, so for making a request to the ValueService you will have to make sure that the accountUuid of the authenticated user is available in your service at the time of the request.\n"});index.add({'id':83,'href':'/ocis/development/tracing/','title':"Tracing",'content':"By default, we use Jaeger for request tracing within oCIS.

Use the Docker host ip 172.17.0.1 or its alias host.docker.internal instead. This requires adjusting all relevant config files to use host.docker.internal instead of localhost (config.json in Phoenix and config/config.php in oC10) and changing the phoenix OIDC-callback url. Set the SERVER_HOST and BACKEND_HOST environment variables accordingly. In order to use the same url for development on the host machine, define it as an alias to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts. After all these changes Phoenix will be accessible at http://host.docker.internal:8300 for both development and acceptance tests.\nSetup using standalone Selenium server When running a standalone Selenium server, make sure to set the environment variable SELENIUM_HOST, SELENIUM_PORT and LOCAL_UPLOAD_DIR accordingly.\nRun tests with ownCloud 10 backend  setup the ownCloud 10 backend clone and install the testing app into ownCloud build Phoenix start the Phoenix server set SERVER_HOST to point at the URL where the Phoenix web pages are served, for example \u0026ldquo;http://localhost:8300\u0026rdquo; set BACKEND_HOST to point to the URL of the backend, for example \u0026ldquo;http://localhost/owncloud/\u0026rdquo; to be able to run federation tests, additional setup is needed:  Install and setup a second ownCloud server-instance that is accessible by a different URL.

We use commit IDs to indicate the version of the backend or testrunner we want to use. These commit IDs should be regularly updated in the .drone.star file to keep the CI up to date. We run phoenix UI tests in the following repos in the CI.\n1. phoenix Repo In the owncloud/phoenix repo, we run the tests using both the oc10 backend and the OCIS backend. For the oc10 backend, we use the owncloudci/core docker image which runs the latest daily-master-qa version of owncloud.\nFor the OCIS backend, we use the Commit ID from the owncloud/ocis repo to indicate which version of backend to use. This can be specified in the .drone.star file in the config.defaults section.\n\u0026#39;defaults\u0026#39;: { \u0026#39;acceptance\u0026#39;: { \u0026#39;ocisBranch\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;master\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ocisCommit\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;284a9996dffa912cc1382e259b748c56ddc4aa0f\u0026#39;, } }, If the version you want to run is on a different branch from master, you also need to change the branch name.\nIn order to check if new tests are compatible with OCIS, after changing the commit id and the branch name, we can create a draft PR in owncloud/phoenix which triggers the CI, and we can see the result there.\n2. ocis Repo We follow the same approach in the owncloud/ocis repo too. In order to run the UI tests in CI we use commit IDs from phoenix which can be changed in the .drone.star file.\n\u0026#39;uiTests\u0026#39;: { \u0026#39;phoenixBranch\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;master\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;phoenixCommit\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;492e6a663efad67f770ba4ac405c4d9983d00cd3\u0026#39;, ... } This is the commit ID of phoenix indicating the version of testrunner we want to use. If the version is on a branch other than master, we will also need to change the branch name.\n"});index.add({'id':86,'href':'/extensions/thumbnails/license/','title':"License",'content':"This project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
